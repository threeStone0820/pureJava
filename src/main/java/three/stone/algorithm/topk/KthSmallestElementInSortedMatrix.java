/**
 * Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, r
 * eturn the kth smallest element in the matrix.
 * Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
 * You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: matrix = [
 *                  [1, 5, 9],
 *                  [10,11,13],
 *                  [12,13,15]
 *                  ], k = 8
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
