/**
 * Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
 * Output: 17
 * Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
 * On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
 * On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
 * In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
 *
 * 1 <= days.length <= 365
 * 1 <= days[i] <= 365
 * days is in strictly increasing order.
 * costs.length == 3
 * 1 <= costs[i] <= 1000
